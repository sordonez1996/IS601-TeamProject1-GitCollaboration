# How Docker improves productivity and competitiveness of a company

* Docker really makes it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers, and containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. 
* Docker provides repeatable development, build, test and production environments. 
* Also, launching Docker images is is as fast as running as machine process.
